To all our readers in Denmark,
Please don’t scroll past this. This Tuesday we ask you to sustain Wikipedia. 98% of our readers don’t give; they simply look the other way. If you are an exceptional reader who has already donated, we sincerely thank you. If you donate just 20 kr, or whatever you can this Tuesday, Wikipedia could keep thriving for years. We ask you, humbly: please don’t scroll away. If Wikipedia has been useful to you, take a minute to donate 20 kr. Show the world that access to reliable, neutral information matters to you. Thank you.
